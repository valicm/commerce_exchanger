Install the Commerce Exchanger module as you would normally install
any Drupal contrib module.
Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.


CONFIGURATION
--------------

    1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the Commerce Exchanger
       module.
    2. Navigate to Home > Administration > Commerce > Configuration
                   > Exchange rates.


PLUGIN SYSTEM
--------------
See examples of implementation for external providers.
`\Drupal\commerce_exchanger\Plugin\Commerce\ExchangerProvider\FixerExchanger`
`\Drupal\commerce_exchanger\Plugin\Commerce\ExchangerProvider\EuropeanCentralBankExchanger`


See `\Drupal\commerce_exchanger\Annotation\CommerceExchangerProvider`
for available properties on CommerceExchangerProvider annotation plugin type.

In most cases it would be enough to make proper annotation type
and implement two functions inside your plugin:
`\Drupal\commerce_exchanger\Plugin\Commerce\ExchangerProvider\ExchangerProviderRemoteInterface::apiUrl`
`\Drupal\commerce_exchanger\Plugin\Commerce\ExchangerProvider\ExchangerProviderRemoteInterface::getRemoteData`

Note that function `getRemoteData()` should return array keyed as examples
below. If you follow that format, you don't need to implement anything more
in your plugin.
see `\Drupal\commerce_exchanger\Plugin\Commerce\ExchangerProvider\ExchangerProviderRemoteBase::processRemoteData`
```
['HRK' => '1.3', 'USD' => '1.666']
```

or

```
['base' => 'USD', 'rates' => ['HRK' => '1.3', 'EUR' => '1.666']]
```

Both formats are supported. First is mostly used when you know your base
currency, or it is defined by end provider
(see plugin annotation for European Central Bank).

Second format is redundant, but it is used as fallback on Fixer.io free account.
There your base currency, is based upon your profile on Fixer.io and can be
different from what you are using in Drupal.
